                <h4><span>Message from the Vice Chancellor </span></h4>
                <p>
                  Welcome to the Jatiya Kabi Kazi Nazrul Islam University website, featuring the oldest, largest and the premier multidisciplinary university of Bangladesh!
                </p>
                <p>
                  Jatiya Kabi Kazi Nazrul Islam University was established by the Government of Bangladesh on 09 May 2006, though the initiative for its establishment was taken some years before, firstly by a non-official group of socio-cultural local elites, namely Greater Mymensingh Cultural Forum. The university was originally conceived to be built as the first cultural university in Bangladesh, but the JKKNIU Act enacted in 2006 made it a general university with a special focus on liberal-cum-performing arts education and research.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Since its establishment, the university has been fulfilling the hopes and aspirations of its students and their parents. It has, of course, not only been a lighthouse of learning, but has also acted as a torch-bearer of the people of the region in issues such as democracy, freedom of expression, and the need for a just and equitable society. It has always been associated with high quality education and research in which students as well as faculty members and alumni have played their parts. The Jatiya Kabi Kazi Nazrul Islam University role has expanded beyond its classrooms and research labs during different crises the country has had to face since 1947. In many ways, thus, the university is unique, for it has played a major role in the creation of the independent nation-state of Bangladesh in 1971.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Jatiya Kabi Kazi Nazrul Islam University doors are open for people from all classes, religions and parts of the country, and, indeed, also for international students. Its campus, too, regularly hosts different national and international events and festivals where people from every corner can and do participate. It is a hub, for breeding and nourishing liberal, secular and humanistics values.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the time when our country is dreaming to become a developed nation by 2041 and has made a firm commitment to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, and in an age when we are witnessing the emergence of spirited youths all set to participate in the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), I can affirm that the University of Dhaka is well prepared to meet all future challenges and is ready to lead the nation once again with its acquired experience, available resources, dedicated administrators, experienced faculty members and talented students and employees.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Having been associated with the university for almost 40 years, first as a student, then as a faculty member, and later in various administrative capacities, it is a great honor and proud privilege for me to be here to not only witness but also to contribute to its centenary celebrations from where I am. Let me emphasize too that it is the singular privilege of all of us at the Jatiya Kabi Kazi Nazrul Islam University to be celebrating its centenary in the year that Bangladesh is celebrating its golden jubilee of independence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Joy Bangla. Joy Bangabandhu. <br>
                  Long Live the University of JKKNIU ! Long Live Bangladesh!
                </p>

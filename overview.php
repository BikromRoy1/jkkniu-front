                  Jatiya Kabi Kazi Nazrul Islam University was established by
                  the Government of Bangladesh on 09 May 2006, though the
                  initiative for its establishment was taken some years before,
                  firstly by a non-official group of socio-cultural local
                  elites, namely Greater Mymensingh Cultural Forum.The
                  university was originally conceived to be built as the first
                  cultural university in Bangladesh, but the JKKNIU Act enacted
                  in 2006 made it a general university with a special focus on
                  liberal-cum-performing arts education and research.
